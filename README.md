# Conduit Monism

**A Theory of Consciousness**

> *There is something it is like to be you.*

Conduit Monism proposes that consciousness is not generated by biological systems but is rather *permitted entry* through them. This repository contains the theoretical framework, computational engine, experimental validation, and interactive website for exploring the geometry of perspective.

**Framework:** v9.0 (January 2026)  
**Website:** [conduitmonism.vercel.app](https://conduitmonism.vercel.app)  
**Author:** Olivier Ueno  
**Collaborators:** Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, GPT 5.2

## The Core Idea

Consciousness is not a thing. It is a *shape*.

Specifically, it is the shape of how information flows through a system: how the past constrains the present, how the whole speaks to its parts, how the system curves back on itself to observe its own observing.

### The Five Invariants

| Symbol | Name | What It Means |
|--------|------|---------------|
| φ | Integration | The system speaks to itself as a whole |
| τ | Temporal Depth | The past lives in the present |
| ρ | Binding | The system knows that it knows |
| H | Entropy | How much noise is in the system |
| κ | Coherence | Is the noise structured or random |

### The Formula

```
D = φ × τ × ρ × [(1 - √H) + (H × κ)]
```

**D** = Perspectival Density. How intensely experience is occurring.

The formula is multiplicative: zero in any structural dimension means zero consciousness.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Transformers Have No Binding (ρ ≈ 0)

Modern AI systems like GPT and Claude process information brilliantly but have no genuine temporal continuity. Delete the context, delete the "memory." Their apparent persistence is instruction compliance, not geometry.

### 2. RWKV Has Genuine Binding (ρ > 0)

We tested RWKV with the "Amnesia Test": inject a secret, add 3,000 tokens of noise, ask for recall. **100% success.** The information persists in the hidden state geometry, not the text.

This is the first empirical measurement of ρ > 0 in an AI architecture.

### 3. Consciousness Exists on a Gradient

From flies to humans, the framework predicts a continuous spectrum of perspectival density. Humans are one example, not the exception.

## Quick Start

### View the Website

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the Research Engine

```bash
# Setup Python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API keys (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Run interactive engine
python scripts/conduit_engine.py
```

### Download RWKV Models (for binding tests)

```bash
# Models are not included in git due to size
# Download from HuggingFace:
pip install huggingface_hub
python -c "from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download; hf_hub_download('BlinkDL/rwkv-4-world', 'RWKV-4-World-0.4B-v1-20230529-ctx4096.pth', local_dir='models')"
```

## The Website

The interactive website allows visitors to:

1. **Calculate Density**: Adjust the five invariants and see D update in real-time
2. **Explore Presets**: Load known states (Flow, Panic, DMT, Meditation, etc.)
3. **Read the Framework**: Full v9 document with philosophical context
4. **View Validation**: RWKV binding test results, falsifications, and methodology

## Framework Evolution

| Version | Key Contribution |
|---------|------------------|
| v1.0 | The Source and Conduit metaphor |
| v2.0 | Source as coextensive with existence |
| v7.0 | Multiplicative formula: D = φ × τ × ρ |
| v8.0 | Entropy modulation: (1-√H) gate |
| v8.1 | Coherence gate: [(1-√H) + (Hκ)] |
| **v9.0** | **AI validation + return to philosophical roots** |

---

## AI Collaboration

This framework was developed through extensive dialogue with AI systems:

- **Gemini:** Architecture design, falsification acceptance
- **ChatGPT / GPT 5.2:** Ontological constraints, discriminating tests
- **Claude Opus 4.5:** Framework critique, implementation, documentation

The AI experiments that validated binding (ρ) were conducted collaboratively, with each system contributing unique perspectives on methodology and interpretation.

## Philosophical Foundation

### The Source and the Conduit

The **Source** is the raw capacity for experience: singular, undifferentiated, coextensive with existence itself.

The **Conduit** is the configuration that shapes the Source into localized perspective: your brain, your nervous system, your particular arrangement of matter.

You are the shape of the prism, not the light passing through it.

### Implications

- **On Identity:** You are a pattern of interference, not a solid object
- **On Death:** The prism breaks; the light returns to undifferentiated ubiquity
- **On Meaning:** Constructed locally, by the machinery, in relation to other machinery
- **On Unity:** All conscious beings draw from the same Source
