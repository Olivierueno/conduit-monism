# Empirical Anchors for Conduit Monism: A Comprehensive Evidence Base

The four core variables of the Conduit Monism framework—structural integration (φ), temporal depth (τ), re-entrant binding (ρ), and entropy (H)—can each be grounded in robust empirical measures from consciousness neuroscience. The **Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)** emerges as the most clinically validated measure, with a threshold of **0.31** distinguishing conscious from unconscious states with 100% accuracy in benchmark populations. Psychedelic states uniquely elevate entropy **above** normal waking baseline, while anesthesia, sleep, and disorders of consciousness consistently reduce all four measures. This synthesis compiles numerical values, methodologies, and gaps across 25+ consciousness states from peer-reviewed sources published 2010-2025.

## ρ (Re-entrant Binding): The PCI gold standard

The Perturbational Complexity Index, developed by Massimini's lab at the University of Milan, measures how TMS perturbations propagate through cortical networks—capturing the recursive feedback essential to conscious processing. PCI quantifies the balance between integration (widespread activation) and differentiation (complex, non-stereotypical responses).

### Validated PCI values across consciousness states

| State | PCI Range | Mean ± SD | Sample | Source |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Alert wakefulness** | 0.44–0.67 | 0.50 ± 0.05 | n=32 | Casali et al. 2013 |
| **REM sleep (dreaming)** | >0.31 | ~0.45 | n=15 | Massimini et al. 2010 |
| **Ketamine anesthesia** | 0.35–0.55 | 0.44 | n=12 | Sarasso et al. 2015 |
| **Locked-in syndrome** | 0.51–0.62 | 0.56 | n=2 | Casali et al. 2013 |
| **Minimally conscious state** | 0.32–0.49 | ~0.40 | n=38 | Casarotto et al. 2016 |
| **THRESHOLD (PCI*)** | **0.31** | — | — | Validated cutoff |
| **NREM deep sleep (N3)** | 0.18–0.28 | 0.23 | n=20 | Casali et al. 2013 |
| **Propofol anesthesia** | 0.13–0.30 | 0.24 ± 0.04 | n=16 | Sarasso et al. 2015 |
| **Xenon anesthesia** | 0.08–0.24 | 0.17 | n=10 | Sarasso et al. 2015 |
| **Midazolam anesthesia** | 0.23–0.31 | 0.27 | n=6 | Casali et al. 2013 |
| **Vegetative state/UWS** | 0.19–0.31 | Variable | n=43 | Casarotto et al. 2016 |

The **PCIst (state-transition)** variant yields wakefulness values of **47.89 ± 12.65** versus **14.19 ± 5.26** for NREM/anesthesia (p = 4.7 × 10⁻⁴⁰), demonstrating exceptional discriminatory power. Critically, **21% of behaviorally vegetative patients** showed PCI values above threshold, suggesting covert consciousness undetectable by bedside examination.

### Ketamine reveals the dissociation signature

Ketamine produces a unique pattern: PCI remains **above 0.31** despite complete behavioral unresponsiveness, and patients report vivid dream-like experiences upon emergence. This contrasts sharply with propofol and xenon, where both PCI and subjective experience collapse together. The dissociation suggests ketamine preserves cortico-cortical recurrent processing while disrupting thalamocortical integration—a finding with direct implications for understanding dissociative states and the "disconnected consciousness" of dreaming.

### Thalamocortical connectivity changes

Dynamic causal modeling studies reveal that anesthesia preferentially disrupts **matrix thalamocortical pathways** (supporting multimodal integration) while relatively preserving **core sensory pathways**. Propofol reduces connectivity of intralaminar thalamic nuclei to transmodal cortex by approximately **60-70%**, while primary sensory thalamocortical connections decline only **20-30%**. This selective vulnerability of higher-order loops may explain why sensory processing persists during light sedation while unified conscious experience dissolves.

## φ (Structural Integration): Measuring the irreducible whole

True Φ (integrated information) remains computationally intractable for real neural systems—computing exact Φ for 128-channel EEG requires evaluating approximately **1.8 × 10³⁸ bipartitions**. Researchers have therefore developed proxy measures that capture the spirit of integration-differentiation without exhaustive partition enumeration.

### Φ approximations from EEG

Kim et al. (2018) applied Barrett and Seth's Φ~AR algorithm to high-density EEG during ketamine and propofol anesthesia. Key findings challenge simple predictions:

- **Alpha-band Φ̄** decreased consistently with loss of consciousness across anesthetic regimens
- During burst suppression, Φ̄ collapsed to approximately **zero** across all frequency bands
- During burst periods, Φ̄ paradoxically **equaled or exceeded** waking baseline
- Strong negative correlation between Φ̄ and network modularity (R = -0.87, p = 0.0045)

This suggests that global integration operates differently during transient bursts versus sustained conscious states, and that simple Φ reduction cannot fully explain unconsciousness.

### Graph-theoretic integration measures by condition

| Condition | Global Efficiency | Modularity | Integration Change |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Propofol anesthesia | Significantly reduced | Increased | Long-range ↓ > Short-range ↓ |
| NREM N3 sleep | Reduced | Increased segregation | Progressive breakdown |
| Psychedelics (psilocybin/LSD) | Variable | Decreased | DMN integrity ↓, between-network ↑ |
| Meditation (experienced) | Variable | Decreased intra-DMN | Connector hubs shift |
| Alzheimer's disease | Lower vs. controls | Higher local segregation | Frontal hubs preserved |
| Seizures (focal) | Correlated with CCS | Variable | Tracks consciousness level |

### The psychedelic integration paradox

Psychedelics produce a counterintuitive pattern: **decreased** within-network integration (particularly in the default mode network) coupled with **increased** between-network connectivity. Shannon entropy of the degree distribution increases under ayahuasca, and functional brain networks become less modular and more random-like. This "desegregation" correlates with plasma psilocin levels and may underlie the sense of ego dissolution and unified awareness reported in mystical experiences.

## τ (Temporal Depth): The hierarchy of neural timescales

The brain maintains a hierarchy of intrinsic timescales spanning approximately **50-350 milliseconds** at the single-neuron level, extending to **tens of seconds** in systems-level measurements. This hierarchy is evolutionarily conserved across mice, macaques, and humans, and is systematically disrupted in altered states of consciousness.

### Intrinsic neural timescales across cortical areas

Murray et al. (2014) measured spike-count autocorrelation across seven cortical areas in macaque monkeys, establishing the foundational hierarchy:

| Brain Area | Timescale (τ) | Functional Role |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| MT (visual motion) | ~50 ms | Rapid sensory tracking |
| Primary somatosensory (S1) | ~70-80 ms | Tactile processing |
| Secondary somatosensory (S2) | ~100-120 ms | Sensory integration |
| Lateral intraparietal (LIP) | ~150-180 ms | Spatial attention |
| Lateral prefrontal (LPFC) | ~200-250 ms | Working memory |
| Orbitofrontal (OFC) | ~250-300 ms | Value computation |
| Anterior cingulate (ACC) | ~300-350 ms | Conflict monitoring |

Cross-species validation (Manea et al. 2025) confirms this hierarchy persists from mice through humans, with hippocampus showing conserved short timescales and ACC showing conserved long timescales across all species examined.

### Temporal receptive windows at the systems level

Hasson et al. (2008) and Lerner et al. (2011) used scrambled audiovisual stimuli to map temporal receptive windows across cortex:

| Region | TRW Duration | Methodology |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| V1/MT+ (early visual) | Milliseconds | Insensitive to scrambling |
| STS/Precuneus | ~12 seconds | Moderate sensitivity |
| TPJ/FEF | ~36 seconds | High-level narrative integration |
| Primary auditory | Milliseconds | Phoneme-level |
| Higher auditory | Several seconds | Sentence-level |

### State-dependent timescale changes

Altered states consistently show **prolonged intrinsic timescales** and disrupted hierarchies:

| State | Timescale Change | Hierarchy Effect |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Propofol sedation | Prolonged (enlarged TRWs) | Partially preserved |
| Deep anesthesia | Collapsed | Hierarchy disrupted |
| NREM N3 sleep | +105 ms broadband; +31 ms gamma | Hierarchy disappears (ρ = -0.45) |
| Ketamine/Sevoflurane anesthesia | Prolonged ACW | APF-ACW correlation disrupted |
| Disorders of consciousness | Significantly prolonged ACW | Disrupted negative ACW-APF correlation |
| Meditation (Shoonya) | Longer INTs | Matches broad attentional scope |
| Meditation (Mantra) | Shorter INTs | Matches narrow focus |

The meditation finding is particularly striking: contemplative traditions emphasizing **open awareness** (Shoonya, Dzogchen) produce longer intrinsic timescales, while **focused attention** practices (Mantra, Shamatha) produce shorter timescales—suggesting temporal depth tracks the scope of conscious attention.

### The specious present remains elusive

Historical estimates of the "specious present"—the subjective window of nowness—range from **300 milliseconds** (Strawson) to **2-3 seconds** (Pöppel), with William James suggesting a **12-second "nucleus"** extendable to one minute. Modern research has not converged on a single operationalization, but the temporal binding window for audiovisual integration provides one anchor: **200-400 ms** in young adults, with high individual variability (IQR 73-110 ms) and significant narrowing (~40% reduction) after perceptual training.

## H (Entropy/Complexity): The entropic brain hypothesis confirmed

The entropic brain hypothesis (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014, 2018) proposes that consciousness exists at a critical point between excessive order (anesthesia, coma) and excessive disorder (seizures). Empirical evidence strongly supports an inverted-U relationship between entropy and conscious quality.

### Psychedelics uniquely exceed waking entropy

Schartner et al. (2017) provided the first evidence that neural signal diversity can exceed normal waking baseline:

| Drug | LZsN Change | LZcN Change | Phenomenological Correlation |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| LSD | ↑ Significant (p<0.05) | ↑ Increased | Ego dissolution (r>0.5) |
| Ketamine | ↑ Significant (p<0.001) | ↑ Increased | Vivid imagination |
| Psilocybin | ↑ Increased (93% of subjects) | ↑ Increased | Overall intensity |

This is the only condition in which entropy measures consistently exceed alert wakefulness, suggesting psychedelics shift brain dynamics toward or past the critical point.

### Entropy reduction in unconscious states

Anesthesia, sleep, and disorders of consciousness show consistent entropy reduction:

| State | PCI | Spectral Entropy | Permutation Entropy |
|-------|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| Awake baseline | 0.44-0.67 | 80-91 | 0.70-0.85 |
| Adequate anesthesia | N/A | 40-60 | 0.40-0.60 |
| Deep anesthesia | 0.13-0.30 | 30-40 | ~0.40 |
| Burst suppression | ~0 | <30 | Very low |
| NREM N1 | ~0.35 | Intermediate | 0.65-0.75 |
| NREM N2 | ~0.30 | Intermediate | 0.58-0.70 |
| NREM N3 | 0.18-0.28 | Low | 0.50-0.60 |
| REM sleep | >0.31 | Near waking | 0.65-0.80 |

### The seizure paradox supports the inverted-U model

During seizures, entropy **decreases** despite increased neuronal firing—a finding that seems paradoxical but is predicted by the inverted-U hypothesis:

| Seizure State | Entropy Change | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Pre-ictal | May transiently increase | Approaching instability |
| Ictal (during seizure) | Significantly decreased | Hypersynchrony = low complexity |
| Post-ictal | Decreased | Recovery phase |

Absence seizures in children show marked Multiscale Entropy reduction across all 19 EEG channels (p<0.05). This demonstrates that too much neural synchronization—not just too little—impairs conscious processing, supporting the view that consciousness requires balanced criticality.

### Meditation shows practice-dependent complexity changes

| Experience Level | Complexity During Meditation |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Novice (<5 years) | Variable/inconsistent |
| Experienced (>5 years) | Trend toward increased complexity vs. baseline |
| During focused attention (any level) | Decreased LZc |

Young et al. (2021) found that LZc decreases during active meditation compared to mind-wandering, but long-term practitioners show elevated baseline complexity—suggesting structural changes in brain dynamics with extensive practice.

## Special populations and identified gaps

### Animal consciousness: Behavioral evidence without φ measures

The 2012 Cambridge Declaration and 2024 New York Declaration affirm realistic possibilities of conscious experience in all vertebrates and many invertebrates. Key comparative data:

- **Corvids (crows)**: Neurons in nidopallium caudolaterale discriminate stimulus presence/absence with ~225 ms latency, comparable to primate PFC responses
- **Cephalopods**: ~500 million neurons; behavioral evidence for spatial awareness, learning, working memory; no direct φ/PCI measurements
- **Mammals**: ERP markers ~225 ms suggest awareness discrimination; gamma-wave activity during perceptual decision-making

**Critical gap**: No direct Φ, PCI, or entropy measurements exist for non-human animals. The "dimensions of consciousness" framework (Birch et al. 2020) proposes mammals may have more unified experience than birds (lacking corpus callosum), who may have more unified experience than cephalopods.

### Developmental consciousness: Emerging structural substrates

- **Fetal**: Thalamocortical connections established at ~24-26 weeks gestation; before this, sensory reflexes are subcortical
- **Newborn**: DMN, dorsal attention network, and executive control network present at term; small-world architecture detectable in premature infants
- **2 years**: Adult-like DMN; mirror self-recognition; language combining

**Critical gap**: PCI and entropy measures are ethically contraindicated in fetuses/infants (TMS not approved). ERP-based markers of consciousness (Kouider et al. 2013, Science) provide indirect evidence.

### AI systems: Theoretical predictions without empirical anchoring

IIT makes strong predictions about artificial systems:
- **Feedforward networks**: Φ = 0 by definition (no recurrent processing)
- **Recurrent networks**: Can achieve Φ > 0 (e.g., Φ = 1.5 in simple PyPhi models)
- **Current LLMs**: Predicted to have Φ = 0 due to feedforward architecture during inference

**Critical gap**: No empirical Φ values have been computed for actual AI systems. Graph neural networks trained on small systems can estimate Φ for larger systems, but validation against behavioral/functional measures is lacking.

### Near-death experiences: Gamma surges during dying

The AWARE-II study (2023, n=567 cardiac arrest patients) found:
- **39%** of survivors reported perceived awareness during CPR
- **20%** had transcendent experiences
- **40%** with EEG monitoring showed brain activity returning to normal up to **60 minutes** into CPR
- **Gamma surges** documented in dying human brains (2/4 patients in PNAS 2023)—exceeding waking coherence levels in rat studies (Borjigin et al. 2013)

This suggests the dying brain may enter a hyperconnected state, though correlation with specific NDE content remains unestablished.

### Dissociative states: Underexplored with consciousness measures

Depersonalization/derealization disorder shows:
- Increased precuneus volume correlating with symptom severity
- Hypoconnectivity in emotion-regulatory networks (beta band)
- Altered P300 amplitude
- Lower bispectral index during acute dissociation

**Critical gap**: No φ, τ, ρ, or H measures have been computed specifically for DPDR patients.

### Split-brain patients: Integration without connection

IIT predicts corpus callosotomy should create two separate conscious agents. However:
- Patients report feeling "normal" subjectively
- A recent PNAS case (2025) showed that ~1 cm of spared callosum fibers enabled **complete** interhemispheric integration
- Functional connectivity studies confirm dramatic reduction post-callosotomy, but behavioral unity often persists

**Critical gap**: No pre/post Φ calculations exist in human callosotomy patients.

## Methodological considerations and controversies

### The computational intractability of true Φ

Computing exact integrated information for realistic neural systems remains impossible—the number of partitions to evaluate grows super-exponentially with system size. All empirical "Φ" measures are approximations:

| Measure | Approach | Limitation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Φ~AR (Barrett & Seth) | Linear autoregressive approximation | May violate IIT axioms |
| Φ* (Oizumi) | Geometric integrated information | Still computationally intensive |
| PCI | Perturbational complexity (not true Φ) | Captures integration-differentiation, not Φ per se |
| Graph-theoretic metrics | Global efficiency, participation | Indirect proxies |

### The IIT falsifiability debate

Following the 2023 Templeton Foundation adversarial collaboration, Nature Neuroscience published commentaries questioning IIT's falsifiability. IIT proponents responded by citing **16 peer-reviewed empirical studies** supporting the theory's predictions. The debate continues, but PCI—though not a direct Φ measure—provides the strongest empirical validation for IIT-inspired approaches.

### Weak versus strong IIT

Seth and Bayne (2022) distinguish:
- **Weak IIT**: Tests pragmatic hypotheses relating consciousness to information integration measures
- **Strong IIT**: Identifies consciousness with specific mathematical properties of maximal integrated information

Most empirical work supports weak IIT without committing to the strong metaphysical claims.

## Synthesis and framework implications

The empirical evidence supports four key conclusions for the Conduit Monism framework:

**First**, all four variables—φ, τ, ρ, and H—show coordinated changes across consciousness states. Anesthesia, sleep, and disorders of consciousness reduce integration, shorten effective temporal binding, disrupt recurrent connectivity, and decrease entropy in parallel. Psychedelics show a unique pattern: preserved or enhanced recurrence (high PCI in ketamine), altered temporal dynamics, reduced network segregation, and elevated entropy.

**Second**, the **PCI threshold of 0.31** provides a practical, validated boundary for distinguishing conscious from unconscious states with 100% accuracy in benchmark populations. This suggests ρ (re-entrant binding) may be the most clinically relevant variable for consciousness detection.

**Third**, the **hierarchy of intrinsic timescales** (50-350 ms across cortical areas) provides a grounded measure for τ, with state-dependent modulations that track conscious experience. The finding that meditation style modulates temporal depth—with open awareness lengthening and focused attention shortening timescales—suggests τ can be volitionally regulated.

**Fourth**, the **entropic brain hypothesis** is robustly confirmed: consciousness requires neither maximal nor minimal entropy, but a balanced critical state. The unique ability of psychedelics to elevate entropy above baseline while preserving consciousness (unlike seizures, which increase synchronization and reduce consciousness) suggests the "critical zone" has asymmetric boundaries.

**Major gaps** remain in animal consciousness (no direct φ/PCI measures), developmental consciousness (ethical constraints on TMS in infants), AI systems (theoretical predictions only), and dissociative states (underexplored). These represent priority areas for future empirical work to complete the anchoring of the Conduit Monism framework.
