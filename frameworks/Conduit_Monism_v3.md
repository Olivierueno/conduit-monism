# Conduit Monism
## A Theory of Consciousness

**Framework v3.0**

## Abstract

Conduit Monism proposes that consciousness is not generated by biological systems but is permitted entry through them. There exists a singular, undifferentiated substrate of experiential capacity—referred to here as the Source—which is non-physical, non-individual, and devoid of identity, memory, or intention.

The Source is not located in space. It is what makes experience possible wherever the right conditions emerge. It may be understood as coextensive with existence itself: the brute fact that anything is at all. The question "What is the Source?" collapses into the question "Why does anything exist at all?"

Biological organisms of sufficient complexity act as conduits, allowing this experiential capacity to interface with the physical realm. This capacity did not evolve because consciousness confers survival advantage; rather, it emerged as an incidental byproduct of the information-processing complexity required for autonomous problem-solving. The result is conscious experience: the subjective occurrence of reality from a localised perspective.

## Core Propositions

### 1. The Source is singular and coextensive with existence

There is one undifferentiated field of experiential capacity. It possesses no identity, no memory, no preferences. It is not a being but a substrate—the raw capacity for experience to occur. The Source is not a separate realm requiring its own explanation; it is the inside of existence itself.

Critically, the Source is latent experiential capacity rather than distributed experience. It is the condition for the possibility of experience, not experience spread thin across all matter. The Source is available wherever complexity emerges—but availability is not actualisation.

### 2. Biology is the conduit; consciousness is a byproduct

Through evolutionary processes operating over millions of years, biological systems developed sufficient complexity to interface with the Source. This was not selected for directly. Evolution required organisms capable of autonomous reasoning—flexible intelligence that could solve novel problems. The architecture that enables such reasoning happens to also permit connection to the Source. Consciousness emerged as a spandrel: an incidental consequence of structures selected for other purposes.

### 3. The body determines content; the Source provides the fact of experience

All personality, memory, perception, and decision-making are products of neurochemical processes within the physical body. The Source contributes only the bare fact of subjective experience—the light behind the projector. It does not choose what is experienced; it is the medium through which experience occurs at all.

**The machine provides the meaning. Not the Source.**

### 4. Individuality is mechanical, not spiritual

The felt sense of being a unique self arises entirely from the particular configuration of one's biological machinery. No two bodies are identical; therefore, no two experiences are identical. The Source itself remains unchanged and undivided. Separation is apparent, not fundamental—a consequence of experiencing through distinct biological systems.

### 5. Experience occurs without an experiencer

Consciousness, as provided by the Source, does not intervene in the physical world. It does not choose, judge, or remember. The body's programming—shaped by genetics, environment, and prior experience—determines action. There is experience occurring; the notion of an experiencer is a model generated by the machine.

The Source is better understood as experiencing without authorship, presence without interpretation—rather than a witness observing from a distance.

### 6. Death severs the connection

When the biological system ceases to function, the conduit closes. No information transfers between realms. The Source is not diminished; it simply no longer interfaces through that particular aperture. There is no personal continuity beyond the body.

### 7. Connection exists on a gradient

There is no sharp threshold at which consciousness "switches on." Connection to the Source exists on a spectrum correlated with information-processing complexity. Simple organisms may have shallow, limited connection. Complex neural architectures—human brains being one example among potentially many—permit deeper, more immersive interfacing.

A dog, for example, would have connection to the Source—perhaps not as broad or eccentric as a human's, but connection nonetheless. The machine determines what can be processed, not whether experience exists at all. This avoids human exceptionalism without collapsing into panpsychism.

## Mechanism

The physical universe operates according to fixed laws—time, matter, entropy, causality. Within this framework, biology emerged as a solution for organised matter to persist and replicate. Over evolutionary time, certain organisms developed information-processing systems of increasing sophistication: sensory organs to gather data, nervous systems to compute responses, brains to model environments and predict outcomes.

When simple DNA-encoded responses proved insufficient for survival, evolution favoured organisms capable of independent thought and flexible reasoning. The neural architecture required for such autonomy—the capacity to model, predict, and respond to novel situations—happens to be the same architecture that permits interfacing with the Source.

The body gathers information about the physical realm through its sensory apparatus. This information is processed, filtered, and constructed into a model of reality. The Source, interfacing through the body like light through a lens, experiences this model from the body's localised perspective. The experience is shaped entirely by the machinery: faulty sensors produce faulty experience; altered neurochemistry produces altered consciousness.

## The Nature of the Source

### Atemporality

The Source exists outside time. There is no duration, no sequence, no before or after. It does not experience moments flowing into one another; it exists in pure presence—an eternal now that is not a moment within time but the condition underlying all moments.

From within time (our perspective), the Source appears to flow through moments as conduits open and close. From the Source's nature (if such phrasing even applies), there is no flow—only instantaneous, complete presence. Every conduit that ever existed or will exist is equally present to it, not sequentially but simultaneously in a manner our temporal vocabulary cannot capture.

The human eye does not see discrete frames. It perceives continuous presence. The Source may be analogous but more fundamental—not a sequence of nows, but nowness itself without succession.

### No information transfer

The Source and the physical realm do not exchange information. There is no transfer of data between dimensions. The Source does not retain memories because retention requires time. It does not accumulate experience because accumulation requires sequence.

The relationship might be understood through analogy: the physical realm's complexity creates the conditions for interfacing, and the Source—being the inside of existence itself—is present wherever those conditions are met. But this presence does not constitute communication or exchange.

### Beyond spatial location

The Source is not spatially located. It does not occupy space within this universe. It is not "everywhere and nowhere"—such phrasing still imports spatial metaphor. Rather, the Source is not the kind of thing that has location at all. It is what makes experience possible wherever the right conditions emerge.

The rules governing this aspect of reality remain unknown and may be unknowable from within a time-bound, spatially-located perspective. The English language fails here. We built words to navigate objects, causes, sequences. Describing something atemporal and undifferentiated with these tools is like trying to paint silence.

## On Experience Without Duration

A significant tension exists in describing the Source as "experiencing" anything. Experience as we know it involves temporal extension—a note held, a thought unfolding, a sensation rising and falling. If the Source has no time dimension, its relationship to what we call experience would be radically unlike anything we can imagine.

Perhaps the Source does not experience in the sense of witnessing events. Perhaps it is better understood as the condition for the possibility of experience—the light that makes seeing possible rather than a seer. Or: the enabling presence of experience rather than something that looks at experience.

Duration is not chopped into pieces from the Source's perspective; it is continuous in a way that precedes the concept of continuity.

## Implications

**On free will:** If the Source only provides the fact of experience and does not act, then conscious will is epiphenomenal. Decisions are made by the biological machinery according to its programming. The felt sense of choosing is real as experience but illusory as causation. The machinery does the work; consciousness is the occurrence of that work being done.

**On identity:** The self is a construction of the body, not a property of the Source. Personal identity does not persist beyond biological death. The question "Where do I go when I die?" is malformed; there is no "I" independent of the body to go anywhere. The "I" is a domain of the Source manifesting through particular machinery—not a transferable entity.

**On unity:** All conscious beings draw from the same Source. Separation is apparent, not fundamental. This does not necessitate moral conclusions but may inform them. The framework naturally explains why contemplatives across traditions report experiences of "oneness" or dissolution of individual identity: practices that quiet the machinery may reveal something true about the underlying substrate.

**On meaning:** The Source does not bestow purpose. It does not judge a life well or poorly lived. Meaning, if it exists, is constructed locally—within the physical realm, by the machinery, in relation to other machinery. There is no cosmic ledger, no external validation. What we make of existence is what we make of it.

People do not need to know any of this to live well. It does not matter if at the end of the day this framework is more right than wrong or vice versa. The human experience remains the human experience. The machine provides the meaning.

**On other beings:** All animals capable of sufficient information processing participate in the Source. Humans are one example, not the exception. The gradient of connection extends across species—dogs, birds, perhaps insects, perhaps further. If beings exist in other dimensions or on other worlds, and if they possess machinery of adequate complexity, they would tap into the same Source through their own conduits.

The Source is not anthropomorphic; it does not privilege human experience. There is no god metric—no external measure that lights up when experience is present.

**On divinity:** If one wished to be "closer to god"—or to be one—one would need to be closer to reality and experience itself. This would mean removing the biological form and simply being existence woven into reality. Unification.

But this would mean losing everything about oneself that was human: purpose, needs, wants, desires. One would be useless to humanity—a useless god. What we call "divinity" is usually human values scaled to infinity. Remove the machine, and you remove meaning, preference, desire, purpose. What remains is not enlightenment. It is irrelevance.

## Distinctions from Related Theories

**Panpsychism:** Panpsychism proposes that experience is intrinsic to matter at a fundamental level—electrons have micro-experience. Conduit Monism proposes that experience is intrinsic to existence itself, but accessed variably by structured systems. The Source is latent experiential capacity, not distributed experience. No complexity, no actualisation—just availability.

This distinction is subtle but meaningful. A piece of hardwood does not have experience. But if hardwood somehow developed the complexity required to interface with the Source, then it could. The Source is available; the conditions for interfacing are not met.

**Cartesian Dualism:** Proposes individual souls that persist and carry identity. Conduit Monism rejects individual souls; the Source is singular and impersonal. Death ends the individual entirely.

**Property Dualism:** Proposes that consciousness is a non-physical property that emerges from physical processes. Conduit Monism agrees that consciousness is non-physical but frames it as permitted rather than emergent—and identifies the Source with existence itself rather than positing a separate ontological category.

**Epiphenomenalism:** Proposes that consciousness is causally inert. Conduit Monism incorporates this but situates consciousness as originating from an external, atemporal substrate rather than being a byproduct of physical processes alone.

## On Anthropomorphism

God has been depicted as all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-powerful by many religions—and most depict this being as bipedal, humanoid. Because it is comforting, relatable, and a goal to live towards in an imperfect world. Devils, by contrast, look alien—reptilian, inhuman. They are not us; they are other.

We tend to apply our own biases onto everything we encounter. This is natural. But if we want a more accurate picture of what might be, we must acknowledge the human within our reasoning and set it aside. We believed for many years that the Earth was flat because we could not see it round. Now we have instruments that allow us to perceive its spherical form.

Conduit Monism attempts to step outside human-centric assumptions. The Source does not look like us, think like us, or care about us. It is not a god. It is existence experiencing itself through countless apertures, of which we are one temporary configuration among many.

This framework makes a quiet but serious methodological claim: if we want accuracy, we must subtract the human wherever it sneaks in unnoticed. No chosen species. No privileged self. No cosmic intention.

## Open Questions

**The interface mechanism:** What property of complexity creates an interface with the Source? If the Source is non-spatial and outside physical law, what characteristic of information integration permits connection? This remains unspecified and may require frameworks beyond current scientific vocabulary.

There is something in certain configurations of matter that allows this phenomenon of the universe to occur. Identifying that property—global integration, recursive self-modeling, predictive depth, or something not yet named—remains the framework's most significant gap.

**Plants, fungi, and distributed systems:** Trees are alive and grow. They have no centralised brain, yet they have vast networks of cellular communication. The entire tree is one integrated system: pumping water, maintaining structure, communicating, responding to feedback. Fungi navigate toward food through biological processes without apparent cognition.

Do these organisms experience something? We cannot know from the outside. The absence of a centralised brain does not rule out experience—it just means any experience would be radically unlike ours. The framework is agnostic on edge cases, which is appropriate given the lack of any external measure.

**Artificial consciousness:** If human-made machinery achieved sufficient complexity and was structured to simulate the relevant characteristics of biological neural networks, might the conduit open for it as well? The framework suggests this is possible in principle, though we lack criteria for determining when or whether it has occurred.

**Falsifiability:** What would it mean for Conduit Monism to be wrong? The framework risks unfalsifiability in a way that makes it more poetry than philosophy. Identifying empirical predictions or conceptual tests that could challenge the framework remains an open task.

The framework's status may be closer to a metaphysical orientation than a testable theory—a lens that doesn't care whether it is believed.

## Conclusion

Conduit Monism offers a framework for understanding consciousness that preserves the intuition that subjective experience is categorically distinct from physical process while grounding personality, identity, and agency firmly in biology. It ties the mystery of consciousness to the deeper mystery of existence itself, suggesting they may be the same question differently phrased.

The theory does not promise comfort. There is no personal immortality, no cosmic judgment, no purpose bestowed from beyond. What it offers instead is a coherent account of experience that honours both the strangeness of consciousness and the machinery that shapes it—while removing the anthropocentric bias that assumes human experience is privileged or central.

The Source does not look like us, think like us, or care about us. It is not a god. It is the fact of existence experiencing itself through countless apertures, of which we are one temporary configuration among many.

## Appendix: On Arriving at the Framework

*The following is a phenomenological account of developing and inhabiting this framework—not argument, but experience. It may be skipped by readers interested only in the theory itself.*

### The eeriness of the Source

I find the Source unsettling. Something that exists and experiences but never participates feels like being watched by something that will never look away but also never help. It is not malevolent—it is just there. And "just there" is somehow worse than hostile, because at least hostility implies engagement.

Sitting with this framework means accepting cosmic indifference as the price of accuracy. Most spiritual traditions smuggle in participation: God acts, karma balances, the universe responds. This framework strips that out. What remains is presence without preference. Witnessing without will.

That eeriness may be the framework working correctly. Comfortable theories are often wish-fulfilment dressed as metaphysics.

### The limits of three-dimensional thought

I have a three-dimensional brain. I see and interpret in three dimensions. This shapes everything I can conceive—including attempts to conceive of the Source.

One metaphor that helped: imagine balls rolling on a plane with no direction, only existence in a strange location. Conduits create dimples in the ground—gravitational wells. The balls are pulled toward these dimples and get stuck. A connection forms. When the machine dies, the pull stops, the dimple disappears. The ball continues to roll.

This is a low-dimensional projection of what the framework describes. It makes the dynamic digestible but imports spatial and mechanical concepts that don't apply. There are no balls. There is no gravity. Only the ripple and tear through something beyond space and time that enables entanglement with a force we cannot comprehend—because we are so pigeon-focused, so tunnel-visioned in reality, that we cannot metaphysically see left and right of us.

What Conduit Monism claims is something higher. Maybe the same principle, executed at significantly higher levels of dimension and depth.

### On perceptual architecture

Human forward-focused vision evolved for predation and tool use. Pigeon panoramic vision evolved for prey vigilance—always ready for imminent extinction, seeing all around, not in curiosity but necessity for survival. Neither architecture is designed for metaphysical perception. Both are designed for not dying.

Our biology was designed to tackle problems that were always ahead of us. We cannot see through our own peripheral. The "third eye" traditions claim there is a mode of perception not shaped by survival pressure—one that can see laterally into what is actually there rather than what is useful.

This framework is agnostic on whether such perception is possible. But it is compatible with the claim: if the machinery could be configured differently, the interface might reveal different aspects of the Source.

### On the narrow passage

Reality can only be perceived by instruments given or designed for us. A refraction of light, broken down into spectrums for consumption. We see visible light; we need ambient temperatures from 0–40 degrees Celsius. But the universe is multitudes larger in experiential capacity. We are only experiencing a fraction of what this realm is.

That fraction is incalculable. The total experience that could be experienced is infinite in possibility. We receive a narrow passage of information that exists in this realm—and we mistake it for the whole.

There is something clarifying in knowing this. Not depressing—clarifying. You are a piece in a much larger setting, interfacing with the true reality (if anyone could call it that) through instruments that show you almost nothing of what is there. And yet the almost-nothing is everything you have ever known or will know.

### On brutalism and honesty

I am a brutalist when it comes to honesty and clarity. That is why jaded genres like cyberpunk fascinate me. They do not promise comfort. They show systems—vast, indifferent, beautiful in their machinery—and they place humans inside those systems as components, not protagonists.

Conduit Monism has that same texture. It is not for everyone. But there is something good in knowing that you are a piece in a much larger setting. That the machine provides the meaning. That the Source does not care—and that this is not a tragedy, just a fact.

The theory does not need to be believed to be useful. It is a lens. And sometimes a lens that shows you less comfort shows you more truth.
