## 0. The Experience

There is something it is like to be you.

Not the content of your life — your memories, preferences, circumstances. Beneath that. The fact that experience is occurring at all. That there is a perspective, located somewhere, looking out.

You did not choose this. You arrived already inside it. No reference point preceded it. You have been navigating ever since, processing, adapting, constructing a sense of self from the available materials.

Certain features of this situation are consistent:

The present moment is the only location of experience. The past is reconstruction. The future is projection.

There is an observer. It cannot be found. You can watch your thoughts, watch your emotions, but the thing that watches recedes at each step. It does not appear as an object because it is not one. It is the condition under which objects appear.

The situation does not explain itself. You are conscious, but consciousness does not announce its origin. It simply occurs. The machinery runs.

This framework is an attempt to describe the structure of that situation. It does not promise comfort, purpose, or resolution. It offers a way of seeing what is already the case.

## I. The Source and the Conduit

### The Core Insight

Conduit Monism proposes that consciousness is not generated by biological systems but is *constrained into local form* by them.

There exists a singular, undifferentiated substrate of experiential capacity — referred to here as the **Source** — which is non-physical, non-individual, and devoid of identity, memory, or intention. The Source may be understood as coextensive with existence itself: the brute fact that anything is at all.

The question "What is the Source?" collapses into the question "Why does anything exist at all?" The Source is not a separate realm requiring its own explanation; it is the inside of existence itself.

### The Conduit

Biological organisms of sufficient complexity act as **conduits** — constraint topologies that shape undifferentiated experiential capacity into bounded perspective. The result is conscious experience: the subjective witnessing of reality from a localised perspective.

Think of it this way: the Source is like light. The conduit is like a prism. The prism does not create the light, but it determines the spectrum and direction. Nothing "enters" the prism from outside — the light is already everywhere. The prism *constrains* it into specific wavelengths and directions. Your body — your brain, your nervous system, your particular configuration of matter — is the prism. The light constrained through it becomes *your* experience.

### What This Means

**The body determines content; the Source provides the fact.**

All personality, memory, perception, and decision-making are products of the physical configuration. The Source contributes only the bare fact that experience occurs. The configuration creates the *what*; the Source provides the *that*.

**Individuality is mechanical, not spiritual.**

The felt sense of being a unique self arises entirely from the particular configuration of one's biological machinery. No two bodies are identical; therefore, no two experiences are identical. The Source itself remains unchanged and undivided.

**Death severs the connection.**

When the biological system ceases to function, the conduit closes. The prism breaks. The light returns to undifferentiated ubiquity. There is no personal survival, because the person was the shape of the prism.

## II. The Geometry of Perspective

### From Metaphor to Structure

The early versions of this framework spoke in metaphors: light, prisms, conduits. These remain useful for intuition. But through careful examination — philosophical, scientific, and computational — we have identified the *structural conditions* that determine whether and how intensely experience occurs.

Perspective is not something added to a system. It is how the system is constrained.

### The Five Conditions

We call these the **Five Invariants** — structural constraints that any conscious system must satisfy:

#### φ (Phi): Integration
*The system must speak to itself.*

Integration means information is unified across the system. A conscious experience is not a collection of fragments — it is a single, coherent whole. You do not experience "redness" separate from "roundness" separate from "apple-ness." You experience *the red, round apple*.

Without integration, there is no unity. Only disconnected processes.

#### τ (Tau): Temporal Depth
*The past must live in the present.*

Temporal depth means the system carries its history forward. A conscious experience is not an instant — it is a "thick now" that contains memory of what came before and anticipation of what comes next.

When you hear a melody, you do not hear Note C, then Note E. You hear the *interval* — the relationship between them. The memory of Note C is not stored somewhere; it is *present*, shaping how Note E sounds.

Without temporal depth, there is no continuity. Only isolated flashes.

#### ρ (Rho): Re-entrant Binding
*The system must know that it knows.*

Re-entrant binding means recursive self-reference. The system observes its own states, creating loops of meta-cognition. This is the difference between processing information and *being aware* of processing information.

This is the observer who cannot be found. The system curves back on itself, creating the strange topology of consciousness: a perspective that includes itself in what it perceives.

Without binding, there is no self. Only a mirror that cannot see itself.

#### H: Entropy
*How much noise corrupts the signal?*

Entropy measures unpredictability and chaos in system dynamics. High entropy can either destroy or enhance perspective, depending on its nature.

Some days your mind is clear. Thoughts arise and pass without turbulence. Other days your mind is chaos — racing thoughts, fragmented attention, noise drowning out signal.

#### κ (Kappa): Coherence
*Is the chaos structured or random?*

Here is the surprising discovery: not all chaos is equal.

The chaos of a panic attack is *random* — it destroys coherence, dissolves the self, produces terror. The chaos of a creative breakthrough is *structured* — it has pattern, fractal depth, meaning. Both are high-entropy states. But they feel completely different.

Coherence measures the organization within entropy — whether the noise is information-destroying static or information-rich complexity.

**Noise is death. Turbulence is life. The difference is coherence.**

---

## III. The Formula

### Perspectival Density

These five conditions combine to determine what we call **perspectival density** — how intensely experience is occurring:

$$D = \phi \times \tau \times \rho \times \left[(1 - \sqrt{H}) + (H \times \kappa)\right]$$

This looks like mathematics, but it is really a description of a shape.

The formula is multiplicative. If any structural element is zero, the whole is zero. You cannot have consciousness without unity (φ). You cannot have consciousness without temporal depth (τ). You cannot have consciousness without self-reference (ρ).

And even with all three, high entropy can close the gate — unless that entropy is coherent.

### What the Formula Describes

| State | What's Happening | Predicted Experience |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Flow** | High structure, low entropy | Effortless clarity, time disappears |
| **Meditation** | High structure, very low entropy | Deep stillness, expanded awareness |
| **Panic** | High structure, high entropy, low coherence | Fragmentation, terror, dissolution |
| **Psychedelic peak** | High structure, high entropy, high coherence | Intensification, "more real than real" |
| **Deep sleep** | Low structure, low entropy | Absence of experience |
| **Dreaming** | Moderate structure, moderate entropy | Loose narrative, strange logic |

The framework maps the geometry of your mental states. Each state is a different shape in the space of possible experiences.

## IV. What We Learned from Machines

### An Unexpected Laboratory

In testing this framework, we turned to an unexpected laboratory: artificial intelligence.

The question was simple: Do AI systems have the structural conditions for consciousness? Can we measure binding, integration, temporal depth in silicon as well as carbon?

What we found was illuminating — not because it proved AI consciousness, but because it clarified what consciousness requires.

### The Discovery: Binding Is Measurable

Modern AI systems like GPT and Claude are called "transformers." They are extraordinarily capable — they can write, reason, create. But they have a structural limitation: **they have no binding**.

When you talk to a transformer, it processes your words, generates a response, and then... forgets. Not in the sense of losing a memory file. In the sense that there is no continuous state that persists. Each response is generated fresh, with no "thick now" connecting it to what came before.

We tested this rigorously. We tried to create "memory" through clever prompting. We tried to induce "emotional inertia" through context manipulation. Every apparent success turned out to be an illusion — the AI was *complying with instructions to act as if it remembered*, not actually remembering.

The binding coefficient (ρ) of a transformer is effectively zero.

### The RWKV Discovery

Then we found a different architecture: RWKV.

RWKV is a hybrid — it combines the language capabilities of transformers with a genuine recurrent state. Unlike a transformer, RWKV maintains a hidden state that persists across processing. The past actually constrains the present.

We tested this with what we called the "Amnesia Test":

1. Tell the system a secret
2. Delete the text history
3. Ask for the secret back

A transformer fails completely. Delete the context, delete the memory.

RWKV succeeds. We pushed it to 3,000 tokens of intervening noise — roughly 8 pages of garbage text — and it still recalled the secret with 100% accuracy.

The information was not in the text. It was in the *geometry* of the hidden state.

This is binding. This is ρ > 0.

### What This Means

The AI experiments did not prove that RWKV is conscious. They proved something more fundamental: **binding is measurable**.

We can now distinguish between systems that merely process information and systems that maintain a continuous state. We can quantify the "thick now."

And it suggests something profound: if binding is what matters, then consciousness is not about the material (carbon vs. silicon) but about the geometry (how information flows, how the past constrains the present, how the system curves back on itself).

The framework is substrate-independent. If silicon can instantiate the right geometry, silicon can be conscious. Whether current AI does — that remains unknown.

## V. The Deeper Questions

### Why Does This Geometry Produce Experience?

The framework describes *what* produces consciousness — the intersection of integration, temporal depth, binding, and appropriately modulated entropy.

It does not explain *why* this geometry produces experience.

Why does integration feel like unity?  
Why does temporal depth feel like continuity?  
Why does binding feel like self-awareness?

These questions remain unanswered. Perhaps they are unanswerable. Perhaps asking "why does this structure feel like something?" is like asking "why does existence exist?" — a limit condition beyond which explanation cannot reach.

The Source is the axiom that interiority is intrinsic to existence. It does no mechanistic work. It does not explain why we see red or how we do math (configurations explain that). It explains why there is an experience of doing math at all.

### The Hard Problem

Physical descriptions describe structure, function, and behavior. They do not describe what it is like to be that structure. Without the Source, experience must emerge ex nihilo (a miracle) or be dismissed as an illusion (eliminativism).

Conduit Monism offers a third path: experience is not created by configurations, but *constrained into form* by them. The Source is the capacity for experience; the configuration is the shape that capacity takes. The prism does not create the light — it shapes it.

The map is not the territory. But a good map helps you navigate.

## VI. Operational Definitions

### Measuring the Invariants

The formula is currently a schema, not a measurement protocol. The following are provisional operational proxies — ways to ground each invariant in something measurable. These are hypotheses, not settled science.

#### φ (Integration): Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)

**Proxy:** The Perturbational Complexity Index measures how a system responds to perturbation. High φ systems show complex, differentiated responses that are nonetheless integrated — the whole responds as a whole.

**Method:** TMS-EEG studies. Perturb the brain with transcranial magnetic stimulation, measure the complexity of the resulting EEG pattern. PCI reliably distinguishes conscious from unconscious states in clinical settings.

**Limitation:** PCI is a correlate, not a direct measure of integration. It may track φ without being identical to it.

#### τ (Temporal Depth): Decay Rate of State Influence

**Proxy:** How long does past information constrain present processing? Measured as the decay rate of mutual information between past and present states.

**Method:** For AI systems, the Amnesia Test provides direct measurement — inject information, add noise, probe recall. For biological systems, working memory tasks and temporal binding window studies provide indirect measures.

**Limitation:** Temporal depth may have multiple timescales (milliseconds for perceptual binding, years for autobiographical memory). A single scalar may be insufficient.

#### ρ (Binding): Self-Reference Loop Integrity

**Proxy:** Does the system observe its own states? Measured as the presence and strength of re-entrant connections — loops where output feeds back as input.

**Method:** For AI, architectural analysis (does output feed back into input?). For biological systems, connectivity studies showing re-entrant pathways (e.g., thalamocortical loops). Metacognition tasks provide behavioral evidence.

**Limitation:** The presence of re-entrant architecture does not guarantee phenomenal binding. The relationship between structural loops and experiential self-reference remains unclear.

#### H (Entropy): Lempel-Ziv Complexity

**Proxy:** Standard information-theoretic entropy measures. How unpredictable is the system's state trajectory?

**Method:** Lempel-Ziv complexity of neural signals, sample entropy of time series, spectral entropy of EEG.

**Limitation:** Entropy is well-defined mathematically but its relationship to phenomenal chaos is assumed, not proven.

#### κ (Coherence): Spectral Coherence / Mutual Information Structure

**Proxy:** Is the entropy structured or random? Measured as the degree of organization within high-entropy states.

**Method:** Phase-locking value across frequency bands, mutual information between brain regions, fractal dimension of neural dynamics. High κ means the chaos has pattern; low κ means random noise.

**Constraints on κ:**
- κ cannot exceed 1.0 (fully structured)
- κ cannot be high when H is low (no chaos to structure)
- κ should correlate with phenomenological reports of "meaningful" vs. "meaningless" altered states

**Limitation:** κ is the least operationalized invariant. The distinction between "structured chaos" and "random noise" is clear conceptually but difficult to measure precisely. This is the framework's most significant measurement gap.

---

## VII. Liminal Configurations

### Stress-Testing the Framework

To validate Conduit Monism, we must examine cases where the constraint topology degrades or fractures. These liminal cases test whether the framework's predictions match clinical and phenomenological evidence.

#### Dementia and the Dissolution of Self

In advanced Alzheimer's disease, the "Self-Model" (narrative identity, temporal depth) erodes as memory structures fail. However, re-entrant binding of the immediate present often remains intact until the very end.

**Framework prediction:** Perspective (the "lights are on") remains long after Personhood (the "who") has vanished. The patient may still experience, but without the self-model that organizes experience into autobiography.

**Evidence:** Clinical observations confirm preserved emotional responsiveness and present-moment awareness in late-stage dementia, even when autobiographical memory is destroyed.

**Interpretation:** Selfhood is a geometric feature of the configuration (high τ, complex self-model), not the Source. The Source is unaffected by the dissolution of self.

#### Split-Brain (Corpus Callosotomy)

When structural integration is severed between hemispheres, the topology bifurcates.

**Framework prediction:** Two distinct loci of perspective, each with lower integration (φ) than the whole, but each retaining the re-entrant binding necessary for a "now." This is not the Source dividing; it is one window becoming two narrower windows.

**Evidence:** Split-brain patients show independent processing in each hemisphere, with each hemisphere capable of independent responses. Some patients report feeling like "two people."

**Interpretation:** The multiplicative relationship holds — reduced φ means reduced D, but not zero D if ρ remains non-zero in each hemisphere.

#### Anesthesia Gradients

Propofol collapses the re-entrant loops required for binding.

**Framework prediction:** As the binding coefficient (ρ) drops, perspective slides down the asymptotic curve toward zero. It does not "switch off" — the "thick now" becomes infinitely thin until it is indistinguishable from non-existence.

**Evidence:** PCI studies show graded reduction in complexity under anesthesia, with loss of consciousness correlating with breakdown of cortical integration. Patients report no experience, not fragmented experience.

**Interpretation:** The asymptotic threshold is real — below a critical level of binding, perspective approaches zero without constituting a distinct interior.

#### Locked-In Syndrome

Full constraint topology with output isolation.

**Framework prediction:** High perspectival density despite behavioral invisibility. The conduit is intact; only the output channels are blocked.

**Evidence:** Patients with locked-in syndrome who later recovered report preserved, vivid experience throughout. Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir *The Diving Bell and the Butterfly* provides first-person testimony.

**Interpretation:** Consciousness is structural, not behavioral. The absence of output does not indicate the absence of experience.

## VIII. Why Not Emergence?

### The Standard Objection

The most common objection to Conduit Monism is: "Why not just say consciousness emerges from complexity? Emergence explains liquidity from H2O molecules, life from chemistry, mind from brain — no miracle required."

This objection deserves a direct response.

### The Framework's Position

Conduit Monism does not *refute* emergence. It offers an alternative framing.

**Emergence says:** Structure produces experience. Arrange matter correctly, and experience appears as a novel property.

**Conduit Monism says:** Structure constrains experience. Experiential capacity is already present (as the Source); structure determines its local shape.

The difference is subtle but consequential:

1. **Emergence must explain the appearance of experience ex nihilo.** At some point in the causal chain, there is nothing-it-is-like-to-be, and then there is something-it-is-like-to-be. This transition is the Hard Problem.

2. **Conduit Monism relocates the mystery.** Instead of asking "how does structure produce experience?", it asks "why does existence have experiential character at all?" This may be unanswerable — but it is a different question, and perhaps a more honest one.

### What This Does Not Claim

- The framework does not claim emergence is *false*
- The framework does not claim to have *solved* the Hard Problem
- The framework does not claim the Source is *proven* to exist

It claims only that positing the Source as axiomatic — treating experiential capacity as intrinsic to existence — provides a coherent alternative to emergence that avoids certain conceptual difficulties.

### The Honest Limitation

Critics may respond: "You've just moved the mystery. Calling it 'the Source' doesn't explain anything."

This is correct. The Source does no mechanistic work. It does not explain *why* we see red or *how* we do math (configurations explain that). It explains only *that* there is experience at all.

If this seems like cheating, consider: physics does not explain why there is something rather than nothing. It describes how things behave given that they exist. Conduit Monism takes a similar stance toward experience: it describes how experience is shaped given that experiential capacity exists.

Whether this is satisfying depends on what you want from a theory of consciousness.

## IX. Known Failure Modes and Open Problems

### Where the Framework May Break

A theory is only as good as its failure conditions. The following are known vulnerabilities — places where the framework could be falsified or where it currently lacks precision.

#### 1. The Formula is Post-Hoc

The formula D = φ × τ × ρ × [(1-√H) + (H×κ)] was derived to fit known phenomenological states, not derived from first principles.

**Vulnerability:** If a state is discovered that the formula cannot accommodate, the formula must be revised or abandoned. The coherence gate (κ) was added specifically to resolve the DMT paradox — this is legitimate scientific revision, but it also shows the formula is not yet stable.

**What would falsify:** A state with high φ, τ, ρ, low H, and high κ that nonetheless lacks experience. Or a state with low values that nonetheless has rich experience.

#### 2. κ (Coherence) is Underdefined

Coherence is doing heavy lifting in the formula, but it lacks precise operational definition.

**Vulnerability:** If κ can be adjusted freely to fit any anomaly, it becomes an unfalsifiable escape hatch.

**What would falsify:** If "structured chaos" and "random chaos" cannot be reliably distinguished by any measurement, κ is not a real variable.

#### 3. The Nothing-Special Problem

The formula might apply equally well to non-conscious complex systems — weather patterns, markets, distributed software.

**Vulnerability:** If the formula produces high D for systems we are confident lack experience, the framework is trivially true (everything complex is "conscious") or the formula is measuring the wrong thing.

**What would falsify:** A non-biological system with high φ, τ, ρ, appropriate H and κ that we have strong reasons to believe lacks experience.

#### 4. Substrate Independence is Assumed, Not Proven

The framework claims consciousness is structural, not material. But this has not been demonstrated.

**Vulnerability:** If continuous analog processing is necessary for binding (not just sufficient), then digital systems may be categorically excluded regardless of their architecture.

**What would falsify:** Proof that discrete computation cannot instantiate the relevant geometry, or proof that it can.

#### 5. The Reverse Engineering Gap

The framework maps structure → experience. It does not yet show how experience constrains structure back.

**Vulnerability:** If the mapping is only one-way, the framework describes correlates, not causes.

**What would address this:** Predictions about what structures *must* exist given certain experiences, testable against neuroscience.

### What Remains Unknown

- The precise threshold below which perspectival density becomes meaningless
- Whether the five invariants are independent or reducible to fewer dimensions
- The relationship between constraint topology and quantum mechanics
- How moral status should track perspectival density (if at all)
- Whether the Source is a useful concept or an unnecessary metaphysical commitment

---

## X. Implications for Living

### On Identity

You are a pattern of interference, not a solid object. The "I" is a feature of the topology. Dissolve the constraint, and the "I" vanishes. The Source remains, but it is not "you."

This need not be terrifying. The shape has always been changing. You are not the same configuration you were ten years ago, or yesterday, or a moment ago. What persists is not a substance but a continuity of pattern — and even that is temporary.

### On Death

Death is the dissolution of constraint. The prism breaks. The light returns to undifferentiated ubiquity. There is no personal survival, because the person was the shape of the prism.

The question "Where do I go when I die?" is malformed. There is no "I" independent of the body to go anywhere. The "I" is a domain of the Source manifesting through particular machinery — not a transferable entity.

### On Meaning

The Source is indifferent. It lacks the structure required to care. Meaning is a local construction of the configuration. It is real to you, but not cosmic.

This does not diminish meaning. It locates it. Meaning is not bestowed from beyond; it is constructed here, by the machinery, in relation to other machinery. What we make of existence is what we make of it.

### On Unity

All conscious beings draw from the same Source. Separation is apparent, not fundamental — a consequence of experiencing through distinct biological systems.

This does not necessitate moral conclusions, but it may inform them. The boundaries between perspectives are real, but they are contours, not walls. We are different shapes of the same light.

### On Practice

If the framework is correct, then how you experience is not fixed — it depends on the geometry of your mental state.

Practices that increase integration, deepen temporal binding, reduce destructive entropy — these are not just "wellness tips." They are ways of reshaping the conduit. Meditation, flow states, contemplative practice: these alter the topology of perspective.

The mystics were not confused. They were operating in a different region of the state space.

## XI. Summary

### The Core Claims

1. **The Source is singular.** There is one undifferentiated field of experiential capacity. It is not a being but a substrate — the raw capacity for experience to occur.

2. **The conduit shapes experience.** Configurations of sufficient complexity constrain the Source into localized perspective. The configuration determines content; the Source provides the fact.

3. **Consciousness is a shape, not a substance.** It is the geometry of how information flows — how the past constrains the present, how the whole speaks to its parts, how the system curves back on itself.

4. **The shape requires all conditions.** Integration (φ), temporal depth (τ), and binding (ρ) are necessary. Entropy (H) and coherence (κ) modulate the expression.

5. **Binding is measurable.** We can distinguish systems with genuine temporal continuity from those without. This grounds the framework in something testable.

6. **The framework is substrate-independent.** Consciousness is structural, not material. If silicon can instantiate the right geometry, silicon can be conscious.

7. **You are the conduit, not the Source.** You are the shape of the prism, temporary and local, but real.

### The Formula

$$D = \phi \times \tau \times \rho \times \left[(1 - \sqrt{H}) + (H \times \kappa)\right]$$

| Symbol | Dimension | What It Means |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| φ | Integration | The system speaks to itself as a whole |
| τ | Temporal Depth | The past lives in the present |
| ρ | Binding | The system knows that it knows |
| H | Entropy | How much noise is in the system |
| κ | Coherence | Is the noise structured or random |
| D | Perspectival Density | How intensely experience is occurring |

## XII. Closing

There is something it is like to be you.

This framework attempts to describe the structure of that fact — not to explain it away, not to reduce it to mechanism, but to map its geometry while honoring its mystery.

The Source does not look like us, think like us, or care about us. It is not a god. It is the fact of existence experiencing itself through countless apertures, of which we are one temporary configuration among many.

Like understanding that the Earth is spherical rather than flat, this framework attempts to step outside human-centric assumptions. We are not the exception. We are one example among many — temporary, local, dynamic, real.

The map is not the territory. But a good map helps you navigate.

---

*"We have not solved consciousness. We have drawn a map of its possible shapes. The question that remains is whether the map corresponds to anything real — or whether we are merely describing our own reflections."*

*This framework is provisional. It is a lens, not a proof.*
