## 0. The Experience

There is something it is like to be you.

Not the content of your life, your memories, preferences, circumstances. Beneath that. The fact that experience is occurring at all. That there is a perspective, located somewhere, looking out. Looking through, you.

You did not choose this. You arrived already inside it. No reference point preceded it. No instructions accompanied it. You have been navigating ever since, processing, adapting, constructing a sense of self from the available materials.

Certain features of this situation are consistent:

The present moment is the only location of experience. The past is reconstruction. The future is projection. Yet attention rarely rests in the present. It rehearses, reviews, anticipates. The moment passes while you are elsewhere.

There is an observer. It cannot be found. You can watch your thoughts, watch your emotions, watch yourself watching, but the thing that watches recedes at each step. It does not appear as an object because it is not one. It is the condition under which objects appear. Like witnessing a rainbow, but never able to touch it.

The sense of being a self is persistent but unstable. In focused activity, it attenuates. In social evaluation, it dominates. In the transition between tasks, walking, waiting, the moments no one accounts for, it loosens without disappearing. The self is not constant. It fluctuates with the state of the system that produces it.

Other perspectives exist. You cannot access them directly. You infer them from behaviour, from language, from analogy to your own case. Whether they are having experience, and what that experience is like, remains permanently outside your direct knowledge. You are confined to one location.

This confinement is total but not always felt. Sometimes the boundaries seem permeable, in absorption, in connection, in states where the self-model quiets. Sometimes the boundaries are oppressive, in recursive self-monitoring, in comparison, in the inability to stop performing for an audience that may not exist.

The situation does not explain itself. You are conscious, but consciousness does not announce its origin, its nature, or its purpose. It simply occurs. The machinery runs. Experience happens. The question of why there is something rather than nothing, why experience exists at all, does not receive an answer from within experience.

This framework is an attempt to describe the structure of that situation. It does not promise comfort, purpose, or resolution. It offers a way of seeing what is already the case.

## I. Core Claims

1. **Existence has experiential character.** This is foundational, not derived. The capacity for experience is intrinsic to the fact that anything exists at all. The question "why does existence have experiential character?" may be equivalent to "why does anything exist?"—unanswerable from within existence, or a category error. This experiential character is referred to as the Source.

2. **The Source is singular and undifferentiated.** There are no parts, divisions, or boundaries intrinsic to it. It possesses no identity, memory, or preferences. It is not a being but a substrate—the inside of the fact that anything is. It does not divide when perspective occurs; it is not diminished when perspective ceases.

3. **Perspective requires constraint.** Without limitation, there is no viewpoint—no "from here" as opposed to "from elsewhere." Perspective is geometrically constituted by boundary. The constraint topology determines what is perspectivally available: its bandwidth, its shape, its density.

4. **Certain configurations of matter create constraint topologies sufficient for perspective.** These configurations satisfy three conditions: structural integration, temporal process, and re-entrant binding. Where such configurations exist, experiential capacity actualizes as bounded perspective. This is not transmission or entry. It is actualization of latent capacity through geometric constraint.

5. **Perspectival density varies continuously.** There is no threshold at which perspective "switches on." There are regions of higher and lower density, different geometric shapes, different bandwidths of perspectival availability. The question "is this system conscious?" is malformed. The question "what is the perspectival density and geometry at this configuration?" is coherent.

6. **Constraint topology is dynamic, not static.** The configuration provides the range of possible topologies. The current state determines which topology is active at any moment. Perspectival density and geometry fluctuate continuously within a single organism across time. There is no fixed "amount" of consciousness a configuration has. There is a trajectory through perspectival space.

7. **The body determines content; the Source provides the fact of experience.** All personality, memory, perception, and decision-making are products of the physical configuration. The Source contributes only the bare fact that experience occurs at all. The constraint topology shapes what is experienced. The Source is that experiencing happens.

8. **Selfhood is a feature of certain constraint topologies.** Configurations complex enough to include self-models generate the sense of being a discrete individual. This sense is real as experience but does not indicate ontological separation. The self is constructed by the configuration, not possessed by a portion of the Source. Dissolve the configuration, and selfhood dissolves. The Source is unaffected.

9. **Time is necessary for constraint topology to function.** Integration requires process. Process requires sequence. The binding operations that constitute constraint cannot occur outside time. The Source is atemporal; perspective is temporal. The Source actualizes as temporal perspective only where time permits the operations that create constraint.

10. **Death is the dissolution of constraint topology.** Perspective ceases at that locus. No information transfers. The Source is unaffected because it was never localized. One fewer locus of perspective exists in the physical realm. The question "where does consciousness go?" is malformed. Consciousness does not go anywhere. A constraint dissolved.

11. **There is no combination problem because there is nothing to combine.** The Source is singular. What appears as multiplicity—distinct experiences occurring at distinct loci—is multiple constraint topologies, not multiple portions of consciousness. The division is topological, not ontological. Perspectives are local; the Source is not.

## II. Mechanism

### The Constraint Condition

Perspective arises where a configuration satisfies three conditions jointly. A system lacking any one has no perspective. A system possessing all three has perspective, with density and geometry determined by the depth and complexity of the binding.

1. **Structural Integration (Phi).** The system must be integrated such that the whole cannot be reduced to independent parts. This provides the capacity for a unified perspective. Integrated Information Theory's phi (Φ) measures this structural capacity, though the framework does not commit to IIT's specific formalism.

2. **Temporal Process (Active Inference).** The system must use this structure to minimize surprise (entropy) over time via a generative model. This provides the direction of the perspective. Static structure is insufficient—a crystal may have high structural integration but lacks trajectory. Perspective requires both the wiring (structure) and the operation (process).

3. **Re-entrant Binding.** The immediate past must causally constrain the present. The system must "touch itself" through time. This distinguishes causal binding from mere storage and creates the "specious present" or "thick now" necessary for perspective.

### Re-entrant Binding: The Video Buffer Problem

A video buffer holds information from the past (Frame 1) and the present (Frame 2), but they are causally isolated—one does not shape the other within the buffer itself. They are neighbours, not partners. The buffer contains data but creates no "now."

In a conscious configuration, the past is not stored; it is constitutive. It is re-entrant. The informational state of the immediate past feeds back as input for the present, creating a causal "bleed-through" or tension. When you hear a melody, you do not hear Note C then Note E—you hear the interval. The memory of Note C fundamentally alters the experience of Note E. The past creates constraint that shapes the present moment.

This structural interference of past-on-present generates the specious present necessary for perspective. A hard drive stores the past; a consciousness integrates it.

### The Gradient

- **Zero Integration (Thermostat/Video Buffer).** The system reacts to the present or stores the past as passive data. It lacks re-entrant binding. There is no causal integration of past to present. Perspectival density is zero.

- **Immediate Binding (Simple Organisms/Infants).** High re-entrant integration of the immediate past creates a rich "now" (Temporal Density), but the generative model has a short horizon. Perspective is vivid but reactive. The system has temporal density but limited temporal depth.

- **Deep Binding (Adult Humans).** High integration combined with counterfactual simulation. The system binds not just the immediate past, but modelled futures, into the present moment. This constitutes temporal depth—the ability to die in imagination rather than reality.

### Perspectival Geometry

Different constraint topologies create different geometries of perspective. This is not a hierarchy. A dog's perspective is not "less" than a human's—it is differently shaped. The human configuration permits abstract modelling, temporal projection, linguistic recursion. The dog's configuration permits olfactory immersion, present-moment saturation, pack-relational awareness. Neither is closer to the Source. Both are constraint topologies with different geometries.

An infant's constraint topology differs from an adult's. Not less conscious, but differently configured. The self-model is minimal or absent. Memory structures are forming. The perspective is real but geometrically distinct. Development is the gradual elaboration of constraint topology, not the awakening of consciousness from nothing.

### Temporal Dynamics

Constraint topology is not fixed. Biological systems fluctuate. Moment to moment, the brain's integration patterns shift. Attention narrows and widens. Arousal rises and falls. Neurochemistry oscillates.

The configuration provides the range of possible topologies—the space through which the system can move. The current state determines which topology is active. Perspectival density and geometry vary with arousal level, attention allocation, neurochemical environment, metabolic state, external stimulation, and internal modelling activity.

This accounts for phenomena that static models cannot explain. "Time flies when you're having fun" is phenomenological data: the constraint topology during engaged activity differs from the topology during routine. Flow states involve reconfiguration—narrowing in some dimensions (self-model attenuation), deepening in others (task integration). Dissociation during routine reflects attenuated perspectival density: the capacity was there, the actualization was reduced.

Sleep demonstrates dramatic topology shifts. Deep sleep shows reduced cortical integration—the constraint topology loosens, perspectival density drops. REM sleep shows different patterns: high activity, vivid experience, altered geometry. Meditation traditions describe deliberate topology modification. Psychedelics pharmacologically modify constraint topology.

### Participatory Modulation

The configuration includes processes that modulate constraint topology. Attention is such a process. Intention is another. Sustained practice is another. This introduces influence over perspective.

This does not violate the epiphenomenal status of consciousness. The modulation is physical, causal, part of the configuration's operation. Consciousness does not reach down to change the brain. The brain's processes—which include attention, intention, and learned patterns—alter constraint topology. The configuration participates in shaping its own constraint conditions. The Source remains passive; the configuration is active.

## III. Implications

**On Free Will:** If the Source provides only the fact of experience and does not act, then conscious will is epiphenomenal. Decisions are made by the physical configuration according to its causal structure. The felt sense of choosing is real as experience but does not indicate causal efficacy of consciousness over physical process. The configuration does the work. Consciousness is the occurrence of that work being done.

**On Identity:** Personal identity is a feature of constraint topology, not a property of the Source. The question "where do I go when I die?" presupposes an "I" independent of the configuration. There is no such entity. The "I" is the self-model generated by a particular constraint topology. Dissolve the topology, and there is nothing to go anywhere. The Source continues, but the Source was never "you."

**On Other Minds:** All configurations of sufficient integrated complexity create constraint topologies. Humans are one example. Other animals represent different geometries—not ranked, just differently shaped. If artificial systems achieve sufficient integration with re-entrant temporal binding, they too would constitute loci of perspective. If beings exist elsewhere in the universe with adequate configurations, they participate in the same Source through their own constraint topologies. The Source is not anthropomorphic. It does not privilege any geometry.

**On Meaning:** The Source does not bestow purpose. It does not judge configurations or their outputs. Meaning, if it exists, is constructed locally—within configurations, by configurations, in relation to other configurations. There is no cosmic ledger. What is made of existence is what is made of it. The configuration provides the meaning. The Source provides the experiencing of meaning. These are distinct.

**On Unity:** All perspectives draw from the same Source. Separation is topological, not ontological. This explains why contemplatives across traditions report experiences of "oneness" or dissolution of individual identity: practices that attenuate the self-model aspect of constraint topology may reveal something accurate about the underlying structure. The unity was always there. The configuration created the appearance of separation.

**On Fluctuation:** If perspectival density varies across time within a configuration, then "how conscious am I?" is not a fixed property but a momentary state. Engaged absorption may involve higher density than distracted routine. Sleep involves reduced density. Meditative states involve altered geometry.

This implies that practices matter. Not because they bring one closer to the Source—the Source is equally available always—but because they shape the constraint topology through which perspective actualizes. A life of scattered attention and numbing routine creates one trajectory. A life of cultivated presence and deliberate engagement creates another. Neither is more connected to the Source. But the perspectival texture differs.

**On Divinity:** If divinity means proximity to ultimate reality, then dissolving constraint topology would approach it. But this would mean losing everything that constitutes human experience: purpose, preference, memory, identity. What remains would be the Source—undifferentiated, without viewpoint, without content. This is not enlightenment in any sense meaningful to a configuration. It is the cessation of what made meaning possible. Divinity, so conceived, is indistinguishable from irrelevance.

## IV. Evolutionary Necessity

### The Cost of Perspective

High-density constraint topologies are metabolically expensive. Maintaining a "unified present moment" requires significant energy to resist the entropic tendency toward dissolution. The brain consumes approximately 20% of the body's energy budget despite representing only 2% of body mass. Perspective is a function of Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS) maintenance—keeping the system organized far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

### The Function of the Conduit

High-density topologies were selected because they allow for prediction via simulation. Simple organisms react to the present. Complex organisms predict the future. To predict effectively in a chaotic world, an organism must maintain a generative model—an internal simulation of itself and its environment.

The evolutionary logic: organisms with zero temporal depth must test survival strategies in reality. If they fail, they die. Organisms with high temporal depth can test strategies in their generative models. They can "die" in the simulation to avoid dying in reality. Counterfactual simulation is survival advantage.

### Selection Pressure

The Source did not evolve. The configurations that create constraint topologies evolved. Evolution selected for architectures that happen to actualize experiential capacity in ways that enhance survival. The capacity was always available. The selection pressure determined which configurations would access it.

This explains the trajectory of increasing perspectival density across evolutionary time: from the diffuse perspective of simple organisms to the rich, temporally deep perspective of humans and other complex animals. Not because evolution aimed at consciousness—evolution aims at nothing—but because consciousness-supporting architectures proved useful for survival.

## V. Challenges

### The Hard Problem Is Relocated, Not Solved

Standard formulation: why do physical processes give rise to subjective experience? This framework's formulation: why does existence have experiential character at all? The mystery has moved, not dissolved. Positing the Source as foundational does not explain why there is something it is like to be a configuration rather than nothing. The framework accepts this as a limit. The question may be unanswerable from within existence, or may be malformed. Honesty requires acknowledging that this is not resolution.

### The Madhyamaka Critique

Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy challenges any positive foundational claim. If everything arises through dependent origination, positing the Source as ultimate ground may be a category error. Even emptiness is empty. The framework's claim that experiential character is foundational may be another attempt to grasp at solid ground where none exists. This critique does not refute the framework but suggests holding it more lightly—as useful model rather than ultimate truth.

### Substrate Independence Remains Contested

Does the physical substrate of a configuration matter, or only its organizational properties? Integrated Information Theory claims substrate matters: causal structure counts, not just function. Functionalism claims substrate is irrelevant: the same consciousness could be realized in silicon or carbon.

The framework is agnostic but notes that biological processing is continuous and analog while digital processing is discrete. If digital systems can create constraint topologies, their experience might differ structurally—"stroboscopic" consciousness with punctuated flashes rather than continuous flow. Only recurrent architectures (where output feeds back into input) could create the re-entrant binding necessary for even discrete constraint topology. This remains an open question.

### Falsifiability

What would it mean for this framework to be wrong? If consciousness were demonstrated to be binary rather than gradient, key claims would fail. If configurations with high integrated information and re-entrant binding were shown to lack perspective while simple configurations possessed it, the constraint condition would be undermined. If the unity of consciousness could be fully explained by physical integration without reference to a singular Source, the framework would be unnecessary.

These are weak falsification conditions. The framework's status may be closer to metaphysical orientation than testable theory. This is acknowledged, not hidden.

---

## VI. Distinctions

**From Integrated Information Theory:** IIT identifies consciousness with integrated information (phi). Conduit Monism treats integration as one condition for constraint topology, not identical with consciousness. IIT measures structural capacity; the framework requires structural capacity plus temporal process plus re-entrant binding. IIT can be true within this framework: phi may measure the structural component of constraint topology. But phi measuring high does not mean consciousness is phi. It means one condition for perspective is met.

**From Global Workspace Theory:** GWT identifies consciousness with global broadcasting—information becoming available to multiple cognitive processes. This is a functional account of access consciousness. Conduit Monism is concerned with phenomenal consciousness—why there is something it is like at all. GWT may correctly describe the architecture that enables constraint topology without explaining why that architecture produces experience rather than proceeding in the dark.

**From Panpsychism:** Panpsychism attributes experience to fundamental physical entities—electrons, quarks. Conduit Monism attributes experiential capacity to existence itself but denies that all matter experiences. The Source is latent capacity, not distributed experience. A rock does not experience because it lacks constraint topology. The capacity is available; the conditions for actualization are not met. This avoids the combination problem that besets panpsychism: there is nothing to combine because the Source is already singular.

**From Analytic Idealism:** Kastrup's analytic idealism posits universal consciousness as fundamental, with matter as appearance within consciousness. Conduit Monism shares the consciousness-first orientation but does not claim matter is appearance. Physical configurations are real and causally efficacious. They create the constraints that permit local perspective. The framework is not idealist: it does not reduce matter to mind. It is monist: experiential capacity and physical existence are not two substances but two aspects of one reality.

**From Process Philosophy:** Whitehead's process philosophy treats reality as composed of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that prehend their predecessors. Conduit Monism shares the process orientation: perspective requires temporal operation, not static structure. It differs in treating the Source as singular rather than as constituted by many occasions. Whitehead's God is dipolar—primordial and consequent. The Source has no poles, no aspects, no structure. It is undifferentiated capacity, not a society of occasions.

**From Epiphenomenalism:** Epiphenomenalism holds that consciousness is causally inert—a byproduct of physical processes that does not affect them. Conduit Monism incorporates this: the Source does not act; configurations do. But it differs in locating consciousness in an atemporal substrate rather than as emergent from physical process. Consciousness is not produced by the brain; the brain creates conditions under which experiential capacity actualizes as bounded perspective.

---

## VII. Metaphysical Neutrality

### Strategic Agnosticism

The framework specifies the Constraint Condition in detail but leaves the nature of the Source unspecified. This is a logical necessity, not an oversight.

If the Source is truly undifferentiated, it cannot be described by specific properties—to give it properties would be to differentiate it, which would make it a configuration rather than the Source. To specify the Source is to misunderstand it.

The framework is a theory of the Conduit (the mechanism of limitation), not the Monism (the ultimate substance). It explains the aerodynamics of the wing without requiring a quantum theory of the air.

### Candidate Ontologies

The framework is compatible with several metaphysical identifications of the Source:

1. **Information.** The intrinsic nature of information (Wheeler's "It from Bit"). Consciousness is what information is from the inside. The Source is identical with the informational structure of reality.

2. **Time.** The undifferentiated temporal capacity before it is constrained into sequence. Consciousness is what time is from the inside. Constraint topologies create local "nows" by differentiating the undifferentiated temporal capacity.

3. **Existence-as-such.** The fact of being, appearing as experience from the inside and as matter from the outside. "Existence" is the third-person description; "experience" is the first-person description of the same thing.

The framework does not choose among these. Each is compatible with the mechanism described. The constraint condition operates identically regardless of which ontology underlies the Source.

### Scope

The framework specifies: what configurations create perspective (the constraint condition), how perspective varies (the gradient), why such configurations evolved (evolutionary necessity), and what follows for identity, meaning, and death (implications).

The framework does not specify: why existence has experiential character, what the Source ultimately is, or whether the hard problem can ever be solved. These questions remain open. The framework is complete without answering them—but it does not claim to have answered them.

---

## VIII. Open Questions

1. **Is the constraint condition fully specified?** The three conditions—structural integration, temporal process, re-entrant binding—may be necessary but not sufficient. Are there additional conditions? Are these three reducible to something more fundamental?

2. **Does substrate matter?** Can digital systems create constraint topologies, or does the continuous analog nature of biological processing matter? If substrate matters, why? If it doesn't, what is the relevant organizational property that spans substrates?

3. **What is the lower bound of perspectival density?** At what point does the gradient approach zero? Do thermostats have infinitesimal perspective, or is there an effective threshold below which the gradient becomes meaningless? How would we know?

4. **Can the framework be empirically tested?** What observations would confirm or disconfirm its claims? The Perturbational Complexity Index provides continuous measurement of consciousness correlates. Do its values track what the framework calls perspectival density? What experiment could distinguish this framework from alternatives?

5. **What is the relationship between constraint topology and quantum mechanics?** Recent evidence suggests quantum effects in biological systems previously thought too warm for coherence. Does the constraint condition involve quantum processes? Does the atemporal nature of the Source relate to quantum superposition or the measurement problem?

6. **How should moral status track perspectival density?** If consciousness is gradient, is moral consideration gradient? Do configurations with higher density deserve more consideration? This question may be malformed—moral status may not scale with perspectival properties—but the framework implies it must be addressed.

7. **What determines the trajectory through perspectival space?** If constraint topology fluctuates, what governs the fluctuation? How much is determined by external stimulation, how much by internal dynamics, how much by accumulated patterns? Can trajectories be predicted or only described post hoc?

---

## IX. Conclusion

Conduit Monism offers a framework for understanding consciousness that preserves the strangeness of experience while grounding personality, identity, and agency in physical configuration. It ties the mystery of consciousness to the mystery of existence itself, suggesting they may be the same question differently posed.

The framework redefines consciousness not as a binary property but as perspectival density—a gradient determined by structural integration, temporal process, and re-entrant binding. It explains why high-density configurations evolved (prediction via simulation), why perspective fluctuates (dynamic constraint topology), and what follows from these claims (the constructed nature of selfhood, the locality of meaning, the dissolution that is death).

The framework does not promise comfort. There is no personal immortality. There is no cosmic purpose. There is no judgment of configurations by the Source. What configurations make of existence is what is made of it. The Source does not care—not through indifference, but through the absence of the structure required for caring. Caring requires configuration. The Source is unconfigured.

The framework may be wrong. The constraint condition may be incomplete. The hard problem is relocated, not solved. Falsifiability is weak. These limitations are acknowledged, not hidden. What is offered is a coherent orientation toward the problem of consciousness—one that honours both the fact of experience and the machinery that shapes it, while removing the anthropocentric assumption that human perspective is privileged or central.

Existence has experiential character. Configurations create constraint. Constraint creates perspective. Constraint fluctuates. This is what we are: loci of bounded viewpoint within undifferentiated capacity, tracing trajectories through perspectival space. Temporary. Local. Dynamic. Real.
