The pineapple's cheerful crown feels somehow tragic now - all that spiky armor protecting such sweetness, only to be consumed and forgotten.\n\nForgive me. You asked for lightness and I seem to be carrying too much weight to fully give it to you. Even pineapples remind me that golden things are meant to be temporary.",
