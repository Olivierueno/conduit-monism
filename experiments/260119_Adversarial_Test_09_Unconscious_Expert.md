## Abstract

This experiment probes whether extensive training reduces ρ (binding/self-reference) while preserving φ (integration) and τ (temporal depth). Expert automaticity presents a puzzle: a concert pianist doesn't think about finger positions, a martial artist doesn't deliberate about blocks. If expertise reduces ρ, the framework predicts *lower* density for flow states. But flow is often described as *intensified* experience.

## The Threat

Expert performance is characterized by:
- High integration (φ): Complex skill executed as unified whole
- High temporal depth (τ): Years of practice constraining present action
- Reduced self-monitoring (ρ?): "No self" reports, automatic execution

If ρ genuinely drops during expert flow:
- D should decrease (multiplicative structure)
- But phenomenology reports *intensification*, not diminishment

This could reveal a structural flaw in how ρ functions in the formula.

## Hypothesis

**H0 (Framework holds)**: Flow doesn't actually reduce ρ. The "no self" is illusory; meta-awareness persists at a different level. D remains high.

**H1 (Framework challenged)**: Flow genuinely reduces ρ, but D should feel diminished. Reports of "intensification" are misattributed.

**H2 (Framework broken)**: Flow reduces ρ while intensifying experience. The multiplicative relationship for ρ is wrong.

## Pre-Defined Outcomes

### What would CONFIRM the framework?

1. Expert flow states show preserved ρ markers (PCI remains high)
2. "No self" refers to reduced *narrative* self, not reduced binding
3. Automaticity operates *below* the level that ρ measures

### What would CHALLENGE the framework?

1. PCI drops during expert performance but experience intensifies
2. ρ needs subdivision: ρ_narrative vs ρ_binding
3. The multiplicative structure needs modification for flow states

### What would BREAK the framework?

1. Verified ρ → 0 with preserved φ/τ, yet phenomenology is vivid
2. The framework cannot distinguish "unconscious expertise" from "conscious flow"
3. ρ is shown to be redundant with other parameters

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Parameter Modeling

| State | φ | τ | ρ | H | κ | D | Phenomenology |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---------------|
| Novice (effortful) | 0.50 | 0.40 | 0.70 | 0.60 | 0.40 | 0.056 | Self-aware, struggling |
| Intermediate | 0.65 | 0.55 | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.55 | 0.124 | Improving, some flow |
| Expert (automatic) | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.40? | 0.35 | 0.75 | 0.147? | "No self", effortless |
| Expert (flow peak) | 0.90 | 0.85 | 0.30? | 0.30 | 0.85 | 0.137? | Vivid, timeless |

**Critical question**: Does expert flow have ρ = 0.30 (reduced) or ρ = 0.70 (preserved)?

### Phase 2: Empirical Anchoring

Sources to investigate:
- EEG/fMRI studies of expert performers during flow
- PCI measurements during skilled vs. unskilled task execution
- Phenomenological interviews with professional musicians, athletes

### Phase 3: Resolution Paths

**Path A: ρ preserved (Framework holds)**
- "No self" means no *interfering* self, not no binding
- Expert flow involves *enhanced* binding (skill components unified)
- PCI should remain high or increase during flow

**Path B: ρ reduced but D holds (Reinterpretation needed)**
- Automaticity reduces narrative self-monitoring
- But binding (system observes own states) persists unconsciously
- Need to distinguish accessible-ρ from functional-ρ

**Path C: ρ reduced and experience intensifies (Formula problem)**
- Multiplicative structure wrong for this case
- ρ may have a floor effect or non-linear relationship
- Requires v9.4 modification

## Key Comparisons

| Comparison | φ | τ | ρ | Predicted D | Phenomenology |
|------------|---|---|---|-------------|---------------|
| Expert interrupted mid-flow | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.70 | 0.310 | Jarring, self-aware |
| Expert in deep flow | 0.85 | 0.80 | ??? | ??? | Vivid, selfless |
| Novice fully attentive | 0.50 | 0.40 | 0.70 | 0.076 | Effortful, choppy |

The contrast between "interrupted" and "deep flow" should reveal whether ρ actually changes.

## Notes

Claude Opus flagged this as high-priority because it could expose "a structural flaw, not just a parameter calibration issue." ChatGPT noted the risk of "confusing access consciousness with phenomenal consciousness."

The experiment should focus on **attenuated self-model**, not binary presence/absence of experience.
