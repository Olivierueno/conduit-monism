## Abstract

This experiment targets the most dangerous edge case for the multiplicative formula: "contentless awareness" reported in advanced meditation. If φ (integration) requires content to integrate, then φ → 0 in contentless states, forcing D → 0. But meditators report this as the *clearest* awareness, not unconsciousness. This is an existential threat to the formula's structure.

## The Threat

The formula is multiplicative: D = φ × τ × ρ × [entropy term]

If a meditator enters "pure awareness" with no objects:
- No thoughts → nothing to integrate
- No perceptions → no sensory content
- φ → 0 (no content to unify)
- Therefore D → 0

**Framework prediction**: The meditator is unconscious (like coma)
**Phenomenological report**: Highest possible clarity, "pure witnessing"

This is a category-level failure if not resolved.

## Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Contentless awareness has φ ≈ 0, producing D ≈ 0. The framework correctly predicts minimal experience.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Contentless awareness maintains structural φ even without object-content. D remains elevated.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H2)**: The multiplicative structure is wrong for this edge case. A "ground state" term is needed.

## Pre-Defined Outcomes

### What would CONFIRM the framework?

1. φ doesn't actually reach zero - there's always minimal content (body sensation, breath awareness, spatial sense)
2. Meditators in "contentless" states show preserved integration markers (EEG coherence, information flow)
3. The phenomenological reports are hyperbolic - "contentless" means "reduced content," not "zero content"

### What would CHALLENGE the framework?

1. φ demonstrably approaches zero (flat EEG integration) but D remains subjectively high
2. The framework requires redefining φ as "integration of potential" not "integration of content"
3. A floor term is needed: D = max(D_floor, φ × τ × ρ × [...])

### What would BREAK the framework?

1. Verified φ = 0 with preserved ρ and τ, yet vivid phenomenology reported
2. The multiplicative structure cannot accommodate this case without ad-hoc patches
3. φ must be redefined so fundamentally that prior experiments are invalidated

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Literature Review

Gather empirical data on meditation states:
- EEG markers during jhana/samadhi states
- fMRI connectivity in experienced meditators
- Phenomenological reports with operational definitions

### Phase 2: Parameter Estimation

| State | φ (est) | τ (est) | ρ (est) | H (est) | κ (est) | D (predicted) |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Normal waking | 0.80 | 0.75 | 0.65 | 0.50 | 0.65 | 0.332 |
| Focused attention | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.70 | 0.35 | 0.70 | 0.296 |
| Open awareness | 0.60 | 0.85 | 0.75 | 0.30 | 0.75 | 0.253 |
| Contentless awareness | ??? | 0.90 | 0.95 | 0.10 | 0.80 | ??? |

The critical question: What is φ in contentless awareness?

### Phase 3: Resolution Paths

**Path A: φ ≠ 0 (Framework holds)**
- "Contentless" is phenomenological shorthand, not literal
- Integration of spatial/temporal/proprioceptive ground persists
- φ_min ≈ 0.3-0.4 even in deepest states

**Path B: Redefine φ (Framework modified)**
- φ = integration of experiential *capacity*, not content
- Empty container still has structure
- Requires theoretical justification

**Path C: Add ground state (Formula modified)**
- D = D_ground + φ × τ × ρ × [...]
- D_ground = f(ρ) - pure witness has irreducible density
- Breaks multiplicative elegance

## Key Questions

1. Do EEG integration measures (Φ proxies, coherence) actually drop in deep meditation?
2. Is "contentless" verifiable or just reported?
3. What do contemplative traditions actually claim about φ-equivalent concepts?

## Notes

This experiment was flagged as "CRITICAL PRIORITY" by all four reviewing AIs. Gemini called it the "Boss Fight." If the framework cannot handle this case gracefully, it fails on mystical states - one of its main differentiators from purely neuroscientific approaches.

The resolution may require distinguishing between:
- **Content-φ**: Integration of objects/thoughts/perceptions
- **Structure-φ**: Integration of experiential capacity/potential

This distinction, if validated, would be a major theoretical contribution.
