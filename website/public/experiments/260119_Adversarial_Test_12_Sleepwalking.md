## Abstract

This experiment replaces the originally proposed "Conscious Simplicity" test (C. elegans) per Gemini's critique: we cannot verify worm phenomenology, making it unfalsifiable. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) provides a human-verifiable case where complex behavior occurs with reported absence of experience.

## The Case

Sleepwalkers:
- Navigate complex environments (high φ?)
- Execute learned behaviors (high τ?)
- Report no experience upon waking (low ρ? low D?)

If the framework is correct, sleepwalking should show:
- Preserved φ and τ (behavior requires integration and temporal depth)
- Collapsed ρ or other parameter explaining absence of experience
- Low D despite behavioral complexity

## Hypothesis

**H0 (Framework holds)**: Sleepwalking has collapsed ρ (no binding/self-reference), producing D ≈ 0 despite behavioral integration. The framework correctly predicts "unconscious action."

**H1 (Framework challenged)**: Sleepwalking has preserved φ, τ, and ρ, but D is still low due to entropy/coherence factors. Mechanism needs specification.

**H2 (Framework broken)**: Sleepwalking has high φ, τ, ρ and should have high D, but reports no experience. The formula fails to predict unconscious complex behavior.

## Pre-Defined Outcomes

### What would CONFIRM the framework?

1. Sleepwalking shows collapsed PCI (ρ proxy) → D ≈ 0
2. EEG shows local activation without global integration → φ collapsed
3. The framework correctly predicts: complex behavior ≠ consciousness

### What would CHALLENGE the framework?

1. Sleepwalking shows preserved PCI but no experience reported
2. All parameters appear normal but D should be low
3. Requires adding "access" dimension separate from structural parameters

### What would BREAK the framework?

1. Sleepwalking has D > 0.3 by all measures but verified absence of experience
2. Behavioral complexity correlates with D, but experience doesn't
3. The formula cannot distinguish sleepwalking from waking

## Parameter Estimation

| State | φ | τ | ρ | H | κ | D | Experience? |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| Waking (normal) | 0.80 | 0.75 | 0.65 | 0.50 | 0.65 | 0.332 | Yes |
| NREM N3 (deep sleep) | 0.40 | 0.15 | 0.23 | 0.40 | 0.30 | 0.008 | Minimal |
| Sleepwalking | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? | No (reported) |

### Candidate Sleepwalking Parameters

**Scenario A: Collapsed ρ**
- φ = 0.60 (motor integration preserved)
- τ = 0.50 (habitual patterns active)
- ρ = 0.10 (no self-model, no binding)
- H = 0.30, κ = 0.40
- D = 0.60 × 0.50 × 0.10 × 0.52 = **0.016**
- Prediction: Unconscious (matches reports)

**Scenario B: Collapsed φ (local processing)**
- φ = 0.20 (islands of activation, no global workspace)
- τ = 0.40 (motor memory)
- ρ = 0.40 (some binding within islands)
- H = 0.30, κ = 0.40
- D = 0.20 × 0.40 × 0.40 × 0.52 = **0.017**
- Prediction: Unconscious (matches reports)

**Scenario C: Framework problem**
- φ = 0.70 (complex navigation)
- τ = 0.60 (executing learned sequences)
- ρ = 0.50 (some self-correction observed)
- H = 0.35, κ = 0.50
- D = 0.70 × 0.60 × 0.50 × 0.54 = **0.113**
- Prediction: Marginal consciousness (contradicts reports?)

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Literature Review

Gather neuroimaging data on sleepwalking:
- PCI measurements during episodes (if available)
- EEG patterns (local vs. global activation)
- fMRI connectivity during somnambulism

### Phase 2: Discriminant Analysis

Which parameter best explains sleepwalking unconsciousness?
- If PCI is low → ρ is the key
- If connectivity is local → φ is the key
- If both are low → multiplicative protection

### Phase 3: Comparison with Related States

| State | Behavior | Experience | Proposed Explanation |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Sleepwalking | Complex | None | Low ρ or low φ |
| Automatism (epileptic) | Complex | None/partial | Low ρ, disrupted κ |
| Hypnosis | Variable | Altered | Modified ρ? |
| Dissociation | Variable | Detached | Split ρ? |

## Key Questions

1. Is there PCI data from sleepwalking episodes?
2. Does sleepwalking show preserved gamma coherence (φ proxy)?
3. How does sleepwalking compare to other "unconscious action" states?

## Notes

Gemini's critique of the original AT12 (C. elegans): "Testing on worms is a trap. You cannot verify their phenomenology, so the result will just be your opinion vs. the formula."

Sleepwalking solves this:
- Human subjects can report (or fail to report) experience
- Behavior is unambiguously complex
- Neuroimaging data exists

This is a cleaner falsification test than simple organisms.
